# Background Check API
## Introduction

Harpie's Background Check API screens any Ethereum address, letting you know if it's been involved in hacking, phishing, and other cybercrime. Our results are human-readable and actionable, giving you and your users peace-of-mind while using the blockchain.

Additionally, our background checks let you know if a contract is associated with a protocol: we have a database of over 800,000 smart contracts, along with their deployer and contract name (ex. `Curvefi: 3pool`).

## How it works
We've developed a big-data engine with help from some of Ethereum's most famous data engineers. Using on-chain data, police reports, and other data, we've indexed over 1.8 million malicious addresses and 800,000 verified smart contracts.

## Getting Started
To find your API key, log in to to your dashboard at https://harpie.io/rpc/enterprise/login. You can try out some of our API methods using a rate limited API key (10 requests/minute):
