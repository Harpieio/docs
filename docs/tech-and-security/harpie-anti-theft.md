# Harpie's Anti-Theft Tech

For those curious about how Harpie works under-the-hood, here's a quick rundown of how we protect our users from crypto theft.
- Background Check Engine: We run regular scans of every Ethereum address, and we're able to find if it's involved in hacks, scams, money laundering, or any other illicit activity
- Transaction Firewall: We pre-screen transactions before they get sent out to the blockchain, which lets us prevent users from signing scam transactions.
- Vault: As a last line of defense, we're able to transfer vulnerable assets out of user wallets as soon as an attack is detected, using a trustless transfer system.
All of these features are opt-in and configurable via the Harpie dashboard.
